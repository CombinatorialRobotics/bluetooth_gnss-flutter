Bluetooth GNSS
--------------

This is the source code repo for the Bluetooth GNSS app. Connect your Android phone to external Bluetooth GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou receivers and use their location.

This is the UI part.

The engine part is hosted at <https://github.com/ykasidit/libbluetooth_gnss>.

Preparation
-----------

* Download the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and add the path to `flutter/bin` to your $PATH
* Add `flutter.sdk` to the `local.properties` file (not the bin folder)
 ```
 flutter.sdk=/path/to/flutter
 ```
* Run `flutter pub get` in the *android* directory
* Create the file `key.properties` and add your keystore information
```
storeFile=/path/to/keystore.jks
storePassword=*********
keyAlias=bluetooth_gnss
keyPassword=**********
``` 
* Install the [Lombok plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/android) in Android Studio
  * Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`
  * Click on `Browse repositories...`
  * Search for `Lombok Plugin`
  * Click on `Install plugin`
  * Restart Android Studio 
* Resync project Gradle

Initiate connection using external intent
-----------------------------------------
I'm using [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) to send the intent, but other methods are possible

### Configure the task
On the `TASKS` tab, create a new task (e.g. _Connect GPS_) and add the action _Send Intent_. It is configured as follows:
* Action: `bluetooth.CONNECT`
* Cat: `Default`
* Mime Type: `text/plain`
* Data: _&lt;empty&gt;_
* Extra: _&lt;see json string below&gt;_
* Package: `com.clearevo.bluetooth_gnss`
* Class: _&lt;empty&gt;_
* Target: `Broadcast Receiver`

**json string in Extra field**

Add this string without newlines. All values are optional. Note that `config` is without double quotes

```
config: {
    "bdaddr": "%bt_address",
    "secure": false,
    "reconnect": true,
    "log_bt_rx": true,
    "disable_ntrip": true,
    "extra": {
        "ntrip_user": "taskeruser",
        "ntrip_mountpoint": "taskermount",
        "ntrip_host": "taskerhost",
        "ntrip_port": "2000",
        "ntrip_pass": "taskerpass"
    }
}
```

**Example**

If you only want to override the bluetooth address, you can send this as extra:

```
config: {bdaddr:"%bt_address"}
```

If you don't use the BT Connection Event (see below) but the BT Connection state, you have to use the real address of your device:

```
config: {bdaddr: "00:11:22:33:44:55:66"}
```

If you want to disable ntrip as well:

```
config: {bdaddr: "00:11:22:33:44:55:66", disable_ntrip: true}
```

### Configure the event
On the `PROFILES` tab, you can use a state change or a event. In this example, I'm using the [BT Connection event](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/help/eh_bt_connect_disconnect.html) with the following conditions:

* `%bt_connected EQ true`
* `$bt_address EQ 00:11:22:33:44:55:66`, the bluetooth address of the GPS receiver

This will trigger the event only when my GPS receiver is connected. You can add multiple devices here, which is why I choose this method: in the action, the variable `%bt_address` will be available as well and I'll use that to pass to Bluetooth GNSS.
